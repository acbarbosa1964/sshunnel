# SSHunnel #
### Simplicity is Key ###

This small project basically connects to an SSH server and creates a Socks proxy tunnel similar to using the -D argument in OpenSSH.

When you start the application it will open into your system tray and wait for your input.  After you provide the credentials for the server which you're going to be tunneling through you can click connect.

Simple as that you have your self a fully encrypted Socks proxy tunnel.
